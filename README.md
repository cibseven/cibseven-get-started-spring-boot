Modeling and Process Configuration

Project Structure Conceptual Modeling
Adopt a tree structure to precisely represent the project's file and directory structure. Take the cibseven-get-started-spring-boot repository as the root node, list the src/main directory in detail, further divide it into subdirectories such as java and resources under src/main. At the same time, treat.gitignore, LICENSE, NOTICE, README.md, and pom.xml as first-level child nodes at the same level as src/main. This more detailed conceptual model can clearly and comprehensively display the basic constituent elements of the project, which greatly facilitates developers to understand the overall framework of the project. For example, developers can quickly locate the src/main/java directory where the business logic code is stored and the src/main/resources directory where configuration files and other resources are stored through this model. They can also quickly find the pom.xml file that manages project dependencies and build information.
Version Control Modeling
Use a directed graph to comprehensively model the project's version control. Regard each commit as a node, record the commit information in detail (such as Step-3: deploy and invoke BPMN process, Step 1: setup a Spring Boot application project) as the attribute of the node, and clearly mark the association relationship between commits with directed edges. Start from the initial commit (such as Start: the start of the tutorial), and you can completely trace the development history of the project along the directed edges. In addition, add a timestamp attribute to each node to facilitate developers to understand the order of commits. At the same time, add dependency type descriptions in the directed edges, such as functional dependencies, repair dependencies, etc. Developers can view in which commit each functional feature was added and the dependency relationship between different commits through this model. They can also perform better version management and problem tracing according to the timestamp and dependency type, for example, quickly locate the parts affected by a functional change.
Technical Selection Data Modeling
Build a comprehensive and detailed data model to describe the project's technical selection. Define an entity "Project Technical Stack", which has attributes such as "Programming Language" (value is Java 17), "Build Tool" (it can be inferred as Maven because of the pom.xml file), "Database" (assumed to be MySQL, according to the actual situation of the project), "Middleware" (such as Apache Kafka, etc., according to the project requirements). At the same time, add detailed version information to each attribute, such as the specific version number of Java 17, the version of Maven, etc. This model helps developers quickly and accurately understand the technical environment on which the project depends. When expanding or maintaining the project, they can accurately determine the technical direction based on the detailed technical selection information, such as choosing the appropriate database driver version and determining the configuration and deployment method of the middleware.
Process Configuration
Project Initialization Process
First, check whether Java 17 is installed in the local development environment. If it is not installed, install it according to the guidance in the official documentation.
Open the command-line tool and execute the command git clone https://github.com/cibseven/cibseven-get-started-spring-boot.git to clone the project repository locally.
Then execute git checkout -f Start to switch to the initial development state and prepare for subsequent development according to the tutorial.
Tutorial Learning and Practice Process
According to the sequence of tutorial chapters, from the first step, execute git checkout -f Step-X (X is the number corresponding to the current tutorial step) in the command line to switch to the corresponding code state.
Refer to the external documentation (the guide on docs.cibseven.org), and combine it with the current code state to understand the development objectives and implementation ideas of each step.
Analyze and learn the code in the local development environment. If possible, perform debugging to deeply understand the code logic. After completing the study of the current step, switch to the next step to continue learning.
Project Building and Deployment Process (assuming Maven is used)
Enter the root directory of the project and open the command-line tool. Before entering the root directory, ensure the correctness of the current path to avoid entering the wrong directory, which may lead to the failure of the build.
Execute the mvn clean install command. Maven will download the relevant dependency packages according to the dependency configuration in the pom.xml file, and compile, test, and package the project. During the execution of the command, if there are problems such as the failure to download dependencies, check the network connection and the dependency configuration in the pom.xml file. If necessary, manually download the dependency packages and add them to the project.
After the packaging is completed, deploy the generated executable file (such as a JAR package) to the corresponding server environment, such as a local test server or a production server. During the deployment process, first check the server environment to ensure that the server meets the running requirements of the project, such as installing the correct version of the Java environment. At the same time, during the deployment process, pay attention to configuring the running environment of the server, such as JVM parameters, and reasonably set the parameters according to the performance requirements of the project and the resources of the server. After the deployment is completed, test the project to ensure that the project can run normally.
